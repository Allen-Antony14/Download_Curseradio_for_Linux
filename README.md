Curseradio is a command-line internet radio player for Linux. It provides a curses interface for browsing and playing an OPML directory of internet radio streams12. Here are some key features:

Interface: It uses a curses interface, which is a library for text-based user interfaces1.
Directory: It is designed to use the TuneIn directory found at opml.radiotime.com, but it could be adapted to others1.
Audio Playback: Audio playback uses mpv1.
Commands: It has simple keyboard commands for navigation and control. For example, ↑, ↓ to navigate, Enter to open/close folders and play stream, ‘k’ to stop playing stream, ‘q’ to quit, and ‘f’ to toggle favourite1.
Dependencies: Curseradio requires Python 3 and the libraries requests, xdg, and lxml1.
As for its usefulness, it’s a lightweight and simple way to listen to internet radio from the terminal. It consumes little system resources3. However, it’s worth noting that some users have reported that the favorites functionality is broken3. If you like console software and want to listen to internet radio, Curseradio could be a good choice3.
